Crime Scene Reconstruction Using AI with Deep Learning is a project that uses artificial intelligence and computer vision to automatically analyze crime scene images and videos. The system detects key evidence such as weapons, victims, and spatial relationships, and generates a clear 2D or 3D reconstruction of the scene. By reducing manual effort and human bias, the project helps investigators understand the sequence of events more accurately and efficiently.
